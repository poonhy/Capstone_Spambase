# Capstone_Spambase

The 3 files in this repository are the submissions for the Choose Your Own capstone project for the "Data Science: Capstone" course on edx. I haev chosen to use the spambase dataset from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) to construct a predictor for spam emails.

The 3 files are: i) Spambase.rmd which is the report for the project in rmd format; ii) Spambase.pdf which is the report in pdf form; and iii) Spambase.R containing all the R code for the project.
